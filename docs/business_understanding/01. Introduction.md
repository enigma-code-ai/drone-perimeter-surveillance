### Description - Drone Based Security and Surveillance 

Provide drone-based monitoring for homes, businesses, events, and perimeters. Autonomous systems with AI (e.g., threat detection) are emerging, as seen in $ONDS's focus on active prevention. High growth in defense/homeland security; add counter-drone tech for premium services. Costs: $20K+ for advanced setups; scalable to enterprise clients.

### Phase 1 — Research & Planning (Months 0–2)
- Step 1 - Define MVP use cases & success metrics: Produce 3 prioritized use cases (e.g., perimeter patrol for enterprise, event crowd monitoring, counter-drone detection). Define KPIs: localization RMSE, detection precision/recall, latency, endurance, MTBF.
- Step 2 - Market & regulatory scan: Map competitors, target customers, procurement cycles, and regulatory requirements (EASA/FAA/EU country-level). Create compliance checklist and timeline.
- Step 3 - Risk & feasibility matrix: Assess tech risks (compute/thermal, sensors), business risks (market, supply chain). Assign mitigation owners and contingency budgets.
- Step 4 - Team & tooling plan: Hire/allocate roles (Project Lead, ROS2 Lead, Flight HW, ML Engineer, Security Lead, Test Lead). Decide primary tools: SolidWorks, SW→URDF, ROS2, PX4, Gazebo/Ignition, YOLOv8/TensorRT, Jetson-class boards.
- Step 5 - Project governance & backlog: Create releases, 3-month roadmap, 6–8 week sprints, acceptance criteria templates, and pilot-customer outreach list.
- Step 6 - Data strategy & ethics: Define datasets, consent/GDPR rules, encryption needs, logging policy, and anonymization pipeline.

### Phase 2 — Mechanical & Systems Design (Months 2–5)
- Step 1 - Concept CAD & modular architecture: Produce top-level SolidWorks concepts for modular payload bays (hot-swap), center of mass targets, and ≤5kg payload envelope.

- Step 3 - URDF export & validation: Export URDF (SW2URDF), add inertial properties, joint limits; validate kinematics in Gazebo.
- Step 4 - BOM & supplier sourcing (dual-source): Finalize critical component list (motors, ESCs, compute, LiDAR), identify second-source, estimate lead times and costs.
- Step 5 - EMI/EMC early checks: Define shielding and grounding primitives; micro-level layout constraints for antennas and sensors.
- Step 6 - Acceptance criteria: URDF loads in Gazebo without errors; structural margin > safety factor 2; BOM lead times < threshold.

### Phase 4 — Simulation-Driven Validation & Data Collection (Months 6–11)
- Step 1 - High-fidelity sim scenarios: Create urban/perimeter/event scenarios in Gazebo/ignition with varied lighting, wind, and moving obstacles.
- Step 2 - Synthetic data & domain randomization: Generate labeled synthetic images for corner cases; use domain randomization to close sim→real gap.

- Step 4 - Closed-loop ML validation: Use replayed sensor logs to validate perception & localization; iterate on models.
- Step 5 - Safety & edge-case tests: Fault injection (sensor drop, GNSS denial), communication loss, and safe-return behaviors verified in sim.
- Step 6 - Acceptance criteria: Simulated mission success rate > target (e.g., 95% for baseline), failure modes produce safe behavior.

### Phase 5 — Prototype Build & Field Testing (Months 9–13)
- Step 1 - Prototype assembly: Build 1–3 physical prototypes per CAD/URDF (3D-printed non-structural parts for fast iteration).
